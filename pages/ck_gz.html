              a snack for young people nowadays, its nutritional value 
              is also very high.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>    300 gram chicken gizzards</li>
            <li>    2 green peppers</li>
            <li>    5 chili peppers</li>
            <li>    moderate oil and salt</li>
            <li>    green onion</li>
            <li>    2 slices of ginger</li>
            <li>    2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>    1 tablespoon of sichuan bean paste</li>
            <li>    1 tablespoon of lightsoy sauce</li>
            <li>    2 tablespoons of cooking wine</li>
            <li>    10 peppercorns</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>     Remove the white fascia on the chicken gizzard, 
                soak it in water to remove blood. Fresh chicken gizzards 
                are full of elasticity and luster, and the appearance is 
                red or purple. The stale chicken gizzards are black-red, 
                inelastic and shiny, and the flesh is soft. 
                I don't recommend buying.</li>

                place them in a bowl, add 1 spoon of cooking wine and

                 and prepare green onions, garlic, and ginger.</li>

                for 2-3 minutes. Remove the peppercorns and throw them away. 
                Then boil the chicken gizzards for about 1 minute, take them 
                out of the pot, put them in cold water to cool, and get the c
                hicken gizzards of dry moisture.</li>
